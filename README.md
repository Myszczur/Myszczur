### About me 😄😄🤔
 
Programming has always been my passion 😎, and now thanks to the IT CodersLab school 💖💖 I have made this dream come true.
Of all languages, Java has stolen my heart. 

Of course my heart is still open to other languages as the programming world is what I love.

My adventure with Java did not end at Back-end 💪💪, because from October, again thanks to CodersLab 💖, 
I will make another dream come true, 
namely to become a Java Full-Stack Developer 📫📫✌️✌️

In October I will have another bootcamp training which it includes Advanced JavaScript, Redux and React. 🤔⚡
👋👋👋
