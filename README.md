### Hi there👋

### About me 😄🤔
Programming has always been my passion and now thanks to the CodersLab school of IT 😎 I have made this dream come true.
Of all languages, Java has stolen my heart.

Of course my heart is still open to other languages as the programming world is what I love.

My adventure with Java did not end at Back-end💪, because from October, again thanks to CodersLab😎,
I will make another dream come true,
namely to become a Java Full-Stack Developer with Advanced JavaScript, Redux and React.✌️
